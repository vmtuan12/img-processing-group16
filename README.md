# Goal
This project aims to explore the application of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify handwritten Chinese characters. CNNs are well-suited for image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn and extract hierarchical features from raw pixel data. By leveraging CNNs, we aim to create a model that can accurately distinguish between different Chinese characters based on their handwritten representations.

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To preprocess a given dataset of handwritten Chinese characters, which includes both high quality and low quality images.
- To design and train a CNN model capable of classifying these characters.
- To evaluate the performance of the model.
